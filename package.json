Currently, we have a great variety of financial services such as Venmo, PayPal, etc to choose from but a common theme amongst these services is that there is usually only one \"delegate\", where one person is in charge of all the funds. We wanted to expand on the idea of decentrailized finance to better fit our day to day scenarios and allow everyone that is apart of a group an equal stance by using a voting system.",
