Pooling service that allows groups to use the ONE token to delegate cash flow collectively using multisig wallets.

More specifically, the purpose of this project is to explores the utility of Harmony One's cross chain interoperability of bridging any Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake chains by building a realistic DeFi application. Currently, we have a great variety of financial services such as Venmo, PayPal, etc to choose from but a common theme amongst these services is that there is usually only one "delegate", where one person is in charge of all the funds. We wanted to expand on the idea of decentrailized finance to fit into our day to day scenarios and allow everyone that is apart of a group a stance by using a voting system.
